#scrot-timelapse-wrapper

This is a tiny wrapper around the scrot and wmctrl utilities.

The purpose of using this tool rather than just calling scrot
in a loop, is that it only takes screenshots when specific
virtual desktops are active. The timelapse recording will
automatically pause when you switch to a non-included virtual
desktop. You can even have more than one different timelapse
accumulating from different desktops simultanously.

watcher.py will dump timelapse screenshots that you can stitch
together later with other tools like mencoder.

For example:

    mencoder -oac copy -audiofile music.mp3 -ovc lavc -mf w=640:h=400:fps=12:type=png 'mf://./*.png' -o timelapse.avi

Where *.png are the files generated by watcher.py

For full usage, run:

    ./watcher.py --help
